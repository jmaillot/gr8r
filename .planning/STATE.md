# STATE.md

## Project Reference

**Project:** Projects Studio (gr8r) — self-hosted PM workspace
**Core Value:** simple, predictable access + a workspace that reaches you (push, search,
dashboards) without breaking the zero-dependency discipline
**Current Focus:** Milestone v2.2 Notifications, Search & Delivery (started 2026-11-12)

## Current Position

**Phase:** 56 — Delivery Infrastructure (not yet planned)
**Plan:** none
**Status:** roadmap created, awaiting approval → `/gsd-plan-phase 56`

**Progress:**

```
[##########]----------  0/6 phases

| 58 | Full-Text Search | Not started |
| 59 | Browser Push | Not started |
| 60 | Admin Dashboard & Member Self-View | Not started |
| 61 | Notification Trim | Not started |

## Performance Metrics

- v2.1 close: 1385 unit tests, e2e 109/109, lint clean, i18n gate 0 dead/0 stale
- Runtime dependencies: `{ pg }` + web-push@4.0.0 landing in Phase 59 (dep #2, owner-approved)
- Requirement coverage: 24/24 mapped across Phases 56–61

## Accumulated Context

### Locked decisions (do not re-open)
- **D-12 amended ×2 (2026-11-12):** `web-push@4.0.0` is runtime dep #2 (pg precedent)
- Saved views/columns live in a server `saved_views` table (Phase 34 notif_prefs precedent)
- Admin dashboard is power-admin: private projects fully visible to admins in aggregates (DASH-04)
- v2.1 decisions M-09..M-13 and phase decisions D-53-1..4 remain in force

### Sequencing rationale (from research SUMMARY.md)
- Phase 56 first: every later phase's e2e runs on the dist guard + split build
- Phase 58 (FTS) before Phase 59 (push): the doc-PUT funnel `newNotifs` diff site is
  edited once per concern, never concurrently
- Phase 61 last: gated on D-05 owner rulings arriving during execution

### Known flags for planning
- Phase 58: FTS5 needs Node ≥ 22.16 in `node:sqlite` — probe at boot, LIKE fallback if
  absent; tokenizer decision locks at table creation (needs `--research-phase`)
- Phase 59: needs `--research-phase` (RFC 8291/VAPID, real-device Safari/iOS UAT)
- Phase 56: verify Vite major (8.x → `advancedChunks` vs ≤7 → `manualChunks`)
- Phase 57: General-Access precise granularity locked at discuss-phase (VIEW-03)
- Phase 60: dashboard aggregates still route `memberCanReadProject` per item (power-admin
  means admins see private content — members never see the dashboard at all, 403)

### Standing constraints (every phase)
- Full suite green; EN+FR i18n gate (server keys included); lint clean
- Phase 38 suppression + no-double-send invariants pass unmodified
- Zero migrations where feasible; additive rows use the Phase 34 guarded recipe
- Push payloads ≤4096 octets, tickers never task bodies
- All search/dashboard/self-view results route `memberCanReadProject` or dedicated
  redaction funnels, byte-level leak tests

## Session Continuity

**Last action:** created v2.2 roadmap (Phases 56–61) + traceability in REQUIREMENTS.md
**Next action:** orchestrator presents roadmap → owner approval → `/gsd-plan-phase 56`
